    <h3>
        Create an Accessible Excel Document
    </h3>
    <p>
        Excel is a program in which both students and faculty are able to make spreadsheets and charts online
        to manage data. It is an efficient way for students to organize data and create organized results.
        However, when creating an excel sheet and publishing it for others to see, there are important steps to
        take to make sure your excel document is accessible to those with disabilities. Most of the information
        included in this document is taken from Microsoft's website in an article titled "Make your Excel documents 
        accessible to people with disabilities" (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-excel-documents-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-6cc05fc5-1314-48b5-8eb3-683e49b3e593#PickTab=macOS).
        Please note that certain instructions may differentiate on a Windows, Mac, or using the Web Browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        To makre sure that your document is accessible, "include alternative text with all visuals, add meaningful
        hyperlink text and ScreenTips, give all sheet tabs unique names, remove blank sheets, use a simple table
        structure, and specify column header information."
