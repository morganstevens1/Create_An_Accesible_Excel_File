# Create_An_Accesible_Excel_File
Hello,
This is what I wrote for create an accesible excel file. It was a bit difficult to come up with my own words for them so a lot of it is taken from Microsoft's website which I gave credit to. I used their screenshots too since they are verified by them but if you would like me to add my own screenshots I would be happy to.

I am attaching the HTML I made for it here but I will also upload a PDF of what I wrote from microsofts website (I know it is not the most accessible but I wrote it on notability and it only let me upload it to a PDF!) otherwise I am also going to post the link to see that notability below:

I am having trouble uploading images on HTML, so in the code it is labeled as SS#1, SS#2, etc.. in the order of the document. If anyone could pelase give me a hand I would really appreciate it! 
Please give me feedback in which ever way possible works best for you. If you would like to email me anything my email is mmstevens@brynmawr.edu
Thank you
